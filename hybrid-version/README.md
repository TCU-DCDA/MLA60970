## Assessment Approach

### Portfolio-Based Evaluation

- **Community Contribution (20%)**: Peer support and collaboration

### Multiple Demonstration Options
Students can show mastery through:
- Traditional project submissions
- Video presentations of work
- Interactive demonstrations
- Peer teaching sessions
- Written reflection essays
- Code documentation and commenting

## Getting Started

2. Explore the learning flows and choose creative prompts that inspire you
3. Join the community spaces (Discord/Slack)

## Differences from Traditional Version

This hybrid version differs from the traditional week-based course in several key ways:

- **Flow-based vs. Week-based**: Learning organized around creative themes rather than rigid weekly schedules
- **Choice-driven prompts**: Multiple project options per flow instead of prescribed assignments
- **Extended timeline**: 7 weeks instead of 4 to allow for deeper exploration
- **Community emphasis**: Integrated peer support and collaboration features
- **Portfolio focus**: Continuous documentation and reflection rather than final project submission

## Technical Requirements

- Modern web browser
- Text editor or IDE (VS Code recommended)
- Git/GitHub account
- Access to Discord or Slack for community participation
