## Music

I have been passionate about music for many years, exploring various genres and instruments. My musical journey includes both performance and composition, with a focus on creating meaningful connections through sound. Whether it's playing classical pieces on piano or experimenting with modern digital audio workstations, music remains a central part of my creative expression.

## Poetry

*Poetry* serves as my **outlet for capturing fleeting moments** and deep emotions in verse. I draw inspiration from everyday experiences, nature, and human relationships, crafting pieces that range from traditional forms to experimental free verse. My work explores themes of identity, connection, and the beauty found in life's complexities, always striving to create resonance between writer and reader.

## Digital Lit

In the realm of digital literature, I explore the intersection of technology and storytelling. My work includes interactive narratives, multimedia poetry, and experimental web-based literature that pushes the boundaries of traditional text. I'm particularly interested in how digital platforms can enhance narrative experiences through hypertext, multimedia elements, and reader participation, creating new forms of literary expression for the digital age.
